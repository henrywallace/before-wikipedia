# Before Wikipedia

This repo contains related experiments made while taking Brown University's course [*Before Wikipedia - COLT0610 Spring 2015*](https://courses.brown.edu/courses/spring-2015/colt-0610q-s01) taught by [Prof. Elias Muhanna](http://eliasmuhanna.com/). Here's the course description:
> How did humans organize knowledge before Wikipedia? This course explores the fascinating history of encyclopedic texts, archives, and databases in various cultural contexts. We consider issues of book history, the classification of knowledge, and the obsession to collect, compile, and document everything knowable and unknowable in both real and fictional encyclopedias. The use of Wikipedia in this course is not only tolerated but required. Students will be responsible for originating, composing, and curating new Wikipedia entries over the course of the semester.
